<h2>Cracking the Code Review</h2>
<p>
    Code reviews are vital for ensuring good code quality and fostering teamwork. They serve as one of our last lines of
    defense against bugs and subpar code reaching production. Yet, they often turn into annoying tasks riddled with
    frustration, hostility, unclear feedback and lack of standard practices. How can we improve this crucial process?
    In this session, we will cover:
    - Streamlining the Review Process: How to create the most review-friendly pull requests
    - The Art of Effective Code Reviews: Learn how you should approach a review, how to provide constructive feedback,
    and how to improve collaboration.
    - Elevating Reviews with Automated Tools: Explore tools that reinforce code consistency and quality, from automated
    style fixes to architecture checks. Let's cut through the noise of bikeshedding and focus on the essence of the
    changes!

    This session will leave you with practical tactics for improving pull requests, performing better code reviews, and
    a suite of tools to simplify the review process and boost code quality.
