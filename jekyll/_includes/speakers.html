              Hi! I'm Bert Hubert, and I am an entrepreneur & software developer. I sometimes contribute to science,
              I care a lot about Europe ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º, innovation, climate, biology & health. I'm a former shareholder of
              Open-Xchange, the parent company of PowerDNS which I founded in 1999. In 2020, I joined a government
              oversight board, which I have since left. These days I am a part-time technical advisor at the Dutch
              Electoral Council. Furthermore, I write articles, some of which have been published by places like the
              IETF, IEEE, RIPE, APNIC, the Swedish Electronics Standardisation Institute, but also by
              newspapers/magazines like Nature Scientific Data, De Volkskrant, Nederlands Dagblad, Villamedia,
              De Ingenieur, Knack and others.
