<h2>Demoscene</h2>
<p>
    The Demoscene is an underground computer art culture. The term demoscene comes from the word demo, short for
    demonstration which means a realtime audiovisual application demonstrating the capabilities of the machine 
    it runs on. Since 2023 the Demoscene is <a href="https://demoscene-the-art-of-coding.net/author/art-of-code-team/">'UNESCO cultural heritage'</a> in the Netherlands, so a closer look is long overdue.

<h2>TBA</h2>

Alas, the announced speaker was unable to confirm his attendance so we're searching for a suitable replacement.
