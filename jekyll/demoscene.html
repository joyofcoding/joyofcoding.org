Dave Borghuis has been a passionate advocate of digital creativity and is a familiar face in the demoscene — a unique subculture where code becomes art. His journey began in the era of the Commodore 64 and Amiga, where he started exploring the exciting intersection of programming, visual design, and music.

<p>
From his early days coding on the Commodore 64 to co-authoring the successful application that led to the demoscene being recognized as <a class="ab-link" href="https://demoscene-the-art-of-coding.net/author/art-of-code-team/">intangible cultural heritage</a>, Dave has always believed that code is more than just functional. For him, it’s expressive, playful, and sometimes even poetic.
