    turns out, it’s absurd and a lot of fun! Join Alexander for a lighthearted yet insightful dive into the absurdness
    of using one of the most sophisticated IDEs to create games within your codebase because... well, why not?

    Alexander is a software engineer at JDriven with a unique blend of Dutch and Greek roots—and an even more
    unique perspective on coding. With a master’s in Game Studies from the University of Amsterdam, he’s on a
    mission to bridge the gap between game development and software engineering. Alexander believes these two
    industries have a lot to learn from each other, and he’s passionate about integrating their technologies
    and methodologies to push boundaries in the tech world.
