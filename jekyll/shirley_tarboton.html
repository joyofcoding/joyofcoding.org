<h2>Decarbonizing Code</h2>
<p>
    As Software Engineers, we enjoy writing elegant code - code that is optimised, simplified, readable. But all the
    phases of the software development cycle - testing, deployment, scaling, maintenance, and decommissioning - rely on
    electricity, much of which is still generated globally using non-renewable fuel. We need to consider all the phases
    of the SDLC during the writing process if we are to produce code that is sustainable as well as elegant.

    In 2023, it was estimated that the ICT sector was responsible for between 1.5% and 4% of global Green House Gas
    emissions, and it is now expected that they exceed those of the aviation industry. This includes emissions from
    communication networks, data centres, cloud computing, and mobile devices. Over the last 18 months, we have also
    seen massive growth in the use of Generative Artificial Intelligence. In October 2024, due to the increase in
    demand, Google signed a deal to build several small nuclear reactors over the next 10 years to power its AI data
    centres in California.

<p>
    Given the growing demand for energy from our sector, it is our moral responsibility as software developers to write
    energy-efficient systems with a minimal carbon footprint. This talk will present low-carbon strategies for
    designing, coding, testing, building, deploying, and scaling information services.
    Armed with these strategies we can be joyful in writing decarbonised code.
