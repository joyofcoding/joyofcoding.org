                Yulia Startsev is the JavaScript language lead for the SpiderMonkey compiler at Mozilla.
                She served as a chair and is currently a facilitator for Ecma's TC39, the committee responsible for design and development of the JavaScript language.
                She initiated and runs the TC39 research group, which applies HCI research techniques to JavaScript language features.
                Her interests include programmer psychology, and she hopes that this talk will be interesting as a reflection on how we think and solve problems.
