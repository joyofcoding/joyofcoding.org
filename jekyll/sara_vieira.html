<h2>Your brain doesn't have a fix flag</h2>
<p>
    Depression and anxiety are enormous problems in our work and world in general. But they are topics that are not
    discussed enough and topics that we feel are kind of shameful. In this talk Sara will expose her personal mental
    health issues that she had for a long time so you don't ever feel embarrassed again. She will go through what she
    learned in this horrible horrible journey of putting a fix flag on her brain in the hope that it helps as many
    people as possible.
