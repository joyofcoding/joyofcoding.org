<h2>Why databases are worthy of your affection</h2>
<p>
    Databases are not cool. They appear like ancient technology hidden after arcane interfaces that only their
    long-retired designers could love. People generally interact with databases because they have to, not because they
    like to. But behind the questionable interfaces are basic truths about data, elegant abstractions, and hard-won
    lessons of generations of programmers.
</p>
<p>
    In my talk, I will describe my long-lasting affection with tables, queries and transactions, my experiences in
    building DuckDB, the fastest-growing data management system to date. I will describe how common pains with databases
    are totally unnecessary from a design standpoint and how you, too, might be able to appreciate them.

<p>
    As the co-creator of DuckDB — an in-process analytics database that’s all about speed and simplicity — Hannes brings
    a fresh perspective on data analysis and systems architecture. He loves exploring clever solutions that merge theory
    and practice in remarkable ways and never shies away from making the impossible possible. Join us at Joy of Coding
    to hear Hannes share his passion for (big!) data, smart optimizations, and modular software. Get ready for a talk
    brimming with inventive ideas, hands-on demos, and actionable insights to power up your own coding and data
    adventures!
