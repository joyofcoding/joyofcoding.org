              Joy of Coding is a one-day single-track conference held in Rotterdam. We bring internationally renowned
              speakers to Rotterdam to deliver talks. They cover diverse aspects of the craft, reflecting recent trends
              in industry and academia, as well as a serious amount of joy.
            </span>
                        <h2>It's affordable</h2>
                        <span>
              Joy of Coding is a non-profit event. With the help of our sponsors we keep registration fees low to
              provide the best value-for-money conference of 2025, just like our previous editions!
            </span>
                        <h2>It's by dev, for devs</h2>
                        <span>
              Joy of Coding is organised by a bunch of developers. There is no commercial agenda, the schedule is purely
              based on stuff that developers, like us, love to see. Expert speakers but no talking heads. A place where
              we can all get together and talk about code.
