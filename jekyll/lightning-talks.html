                    "I love mazes. And there are a lot of algorithms for generating them. I am going to demonstrate and explain 5 of them."

                <h3>Accessibility should be built into more software</h3>

                    "A lot of organisations, government and private corporations, are required to make their websites accessible to people with disabilities.
                    But few do, and many struggle. What if we built more guidance and checks into software?
                    In this talk, we'll look at some ideas for putting accessibility where people are,
                    to make their life's and those of end users easier, so that everybody can make the web more accessible."

                <p>
                    "Today’s extreme product development happens in a small but growing number of companies.
                    This presentation will reveal how they have figured out how to truly work remote-first, with no offices, and support part-time and flexible working.
                    Their development teams don’t make estimates, manage huge backlogs, or waste time in meetings.
                    They even skip reject daily stand-ups. The resulting product development is less wasteful, and it is also more human."

                    "'Knowledge is the only thing that increases as you give it away'.
                    Sharing knowledge has been a big part of my life, it was a way for me to make a small difference in the world and made me a better software engineer at the same time.
                    So let's talk about the benefits of sharing knowledge and what are ways you can help both children and adults grow in our wonderful craft."

                    "Women have been historically marginalised in programming language design.
                    This lighting talk explores PL through a feminist lens; what do we believe and programming and gender, and is that true?
                    And what could programming look like when it was created from a feminist perspective?"

                    "Imagine there's a group of people with plenty of money, who figure out they can make even more money by increasing the level of automation.
                    All they need to get there, is to produce products of worse quality, make workers subservient to them so they can exploit them, and break the law.
                    All of that's fine, though, because the government has their backs.
                    This probably sounds familiar. Because it is happening right now with Large Language Models (LLMs)."
