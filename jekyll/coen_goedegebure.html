                Coen is founder of Scyon and is passionate about everything related to cyber security.
                He started his professional career over 20 years ago and has since then worked as a software engineer and architect both in the Netherlands and abroad.
                Over time he discovered that building software was fun, but breaking stuff was even more fulfilling... and he discovered his passion for cyber security.
                Going all-in with ethical hacking, bug bounties, participating in international hacking competitions, secure coding and multiple CISO roles,
                he combined his skills to build bridges between the business, software development and cyber security domains.
                More than 2 years ago, he founded Scyon with the goal of helping organisations in adopting a shift-left approach to their cyber security efforts and bolster their overall cyber resilience.
                In his spare time, Coen loves to spend time with his family, kitesurf, play guitar, participate in competitive hacking tournaments and share his experience and passion with the world.
