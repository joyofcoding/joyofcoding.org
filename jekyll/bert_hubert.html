<h2>Save the world, write more efficient code</h2>
<p>
    "Save the world, write more efficient code!" - as if we need an excuse! But seriously, we are surrounded
    by sluggish systems. And this is not just irritating for ourselves, sluggishness means CPU cycles are
    being burned somewhere, at home or on a server somewhere. And if you have lots of users, and you go
    through kilojoules per transaction, it all adds up.
</p>
<p>
    Previously slow code would simply exhaust your supply of computing power, and we'd have to improve our
    systems to keep things running. These days, organizations can simply buy themselves out of this problem
    by consuming more cloud resources. In the old days, they'd have to fund better software development or
    database optimization, but no more. With more efficient software, we could save SO much CO2 emissions!
    Plus, we would not have to import so many fossil fuels from countries far away, which can only be good.
</p>
<p>
    In this talk, I go over the three levels of efficiency: hard to understand slow, 1 second transactions,
    idiotic things going on. This is the current normal. Secondly, some care has been taken and there are no
    obvious CPU sinks. Thirdly, someone went nuts and the entire service can now run on a single server.
    These three levels can easily span a factor of 100 in computer power requirements.</p>

<p>
    I also take a harsh look at common soures of ridiculously slow software, and what we could do about it.
    Furthermore, I spend some time on how to transition to 'ludicrous speed', and how to get there.
</p>
<p>
    With some work & more efficient systems, we could have more fun AND improve the world.
