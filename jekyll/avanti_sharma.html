                <h2>Unraveling the Journey of a Girl into Coding</h2>
                <p>
                    A little girl’s journey from being a ballet dancer, competitive gymnast, and watching princess movies to the world of coding.
                    How it happened, what she did, what she went through, the challenges, the triumphs, and where she stands today will be shared with the audience.
                    The message will also give some input, tips, and advice to budding coders, or those who have started the journey and have entered into a plateau phase.
                    It’s based on a true story.
