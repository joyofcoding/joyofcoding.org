                    <h2 id="conference">The conference</h2>

                    <p>Joy of Coding 2025 is the 11th edition in a series of conferences dedicated to the art, science,
                        hobby, but
                        most of all <em>the joy</em> of software development. This year’s edition will be held
                        in <em>De Doelen, Rotterdam</em>: a convention center at the heart of the city, easily
                        accessible by
                        public transport and by car.</p>

                    <h2 id="mission">Our mission</h2>

                    <p>We bring internationally renowned speakers to Rotterdam to deliver talks and workshops. They
                        cover diverse
                        aspects of the craft, reflecting recent trends in industry and academia, as well as a serious
                        amount of joy.
                        It’s a whole-day, fully-catered event at an affordable price. We keep the price low for
                        attendees by running
                        the conference as a non-profit organisation and by relying on our sponsors’ generous support, in
                        addition to
                        ticket sales.</p>

                    <h2 id="audience">Our audience</h2>

                    <p>Joy of Coding attracts a loyal and growing audience that consists of hundreds of software
                        developers who
                        are passionate about their code. In our experience, they are especially those of the more
                        curious kind:
                        eager to learn beyond their comfort zone, always striving to be up-to-date with the latest tools
                        and
                        techniques.</p>

                    <h2 id="opportunities">Opportunities</h2>

                    <p>Of course we will get your name and logo noticed when you sponsor.
                        But more importantly sponsoring Joy of Coding sends a clear signal
                        to our community that your company values developers with a passion
                        for coding and continuous learning. It makes you stand out as a joyful
                        company with a pleasant out of the box attitude, one that developers
                        love to work for.
