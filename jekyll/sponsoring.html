        <h2 id="conference">The conference</h2>

        <p>Joy of Coding 2024 is the 10th edition in a series of conferences dedicated to the art, science, hobby, but
          most of all <em>the joy</em> of software development. This year’s edition will be held 
          in <em>De Doelen, Rotterdam</em>: a convention center at the heart of the city, easily accessible by
          public transport and by car.</p>

        <h2 id="mission">Our mission</h2>

        <p>We bring internationally renowned speakers to Rotterdam to deliver talks and workshops. They cover diverse
          aspects of the craft, reflecting recent trends in industry and academia, as well as a serious amount of joy.
          It’s a whole-day, fully-catered event at an affordable price. We keep the price low for attendees by running
          the conference as a non-profit organisation and by relying on our sponsors’ generous support, in addition to
          ticket sales.</p>

        <h2 id="audience">Our audience</h2>

        <p>Joy of Coding attracts a loyal and growing audience that consists of hundreds of software developers who
          are passionate about code quality. In our experience, they are especially those of the more curious kind:
          eager to learn beyond their comfort zone, always striving to be up-to-date with the latest tools and
          techniques.</p>

        <h2 id="opportunities">Opportunities</h2>

        <p>The team behind Joy of Coding is an informal group of seven people all working in IT, backed by a
          non-profit legal entity: the Devnology Foundation. We organise the event because it is fun and because we
          believe the Rotterdam programmer community needs this platform. To keep the event affordable, we rely
          heavily on our sponsors.</p>

        <p>Our supporters are usually companies based in or near Rotterdam, that employ programmers and take quality
          software development seriously. What our supporters have in common is that they understand how enabling the
          joy of coding and a passion for continuous learning results in highly successful software development teams.
