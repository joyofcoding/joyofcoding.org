                <h2>Better Than New: A Mender's Journey</h2>
                <p>
                    Most software developers love creating something new.
                    So when it comes to improving existing code, a common approach is a rewrite.
                    While scrapping what you have and starting fresh might seem intuitive, there's an even better way to modernize software systems â€” mending.

                    In this talk, M. Scott Ford will give you a glimpse into the mender mindset.
                    You'll learn what makes menders tick, why they find so much personal satisfaction in nurturing existing codebases,
                    and which projects will thrive under a mender's stewardship.
