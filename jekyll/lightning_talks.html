            <h3>How to outsmart a maliciously compliant AI-bot.</h3>
            <i>Frans Reijnhoudt</i>
            <p>
&quot;I'm working on a browser-based text game about unit tests to prove a simple truth: nobody writes enough unit tests. In the game, you’re teamed up with an AI bot that writes code. Sounds helpful? 
Well… not quite. This bot is maliciously compliant — meaning it follows your unit tests to the letter but will do everything in its power to avoid actually following the specification. 
It’s like that one coworker who does exactly what you ask, just in the worst possible way.&quot;

            <h3>What Minimalism can teach you about Clean Coding</h3>
            <i><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/leeuwis.eu">Laurens Leeuwis</a></i>
            <p>
&quot;Minimalism is a lifestyle which focuses on simplicity and having purpose. More and more people are minimizing distractions, setting priorities and choosing quality over quantity every day. 
Focusing on the essential is something we can and should also do in our code. In this talk we'll explore some of the principles from minimalism, and see how they can be applied to coding.&quot;

            <h3>Programming art</h3>
            <i><a href="https://www.instagram.com/Jeffrey.Arts">Jeffrey Arts</a></i>
            <p>
&quot;In this 5 minute talk I'd like to tell people about my process of how I have developed my own algorithm which I try to re-explore via various paths to create different outputs. 
Sculptures made of concrete, steel &amp; electrical tubing, collages with AI-generated images, illustrations that I've used to create 1200+ paintings of 10x10cm and perhaps 
even a JS layout system that originated from this algorithm.&quot;

            <h3>Distributed Pi: how i computed 100 million digits of pi</h3>
            <i>Jip Hoogdam</i>
            <p>
&quot;In this talk, I will discuss some of my (mis)steps in computing as many digits of pi as I could starting with a simple single-threaded application and ending with a multi-threaded approach on a small computer grid.&quot;
            </p>

            <h3>Neurowhat? ADHD and software development from the trenches</h3>
            <i><a href="https://www.hachyderm.io/@nightwhistler">Alex Kuiper</a></i>
            <p>
&quot;I have known that I have ADHD since the late 1980s. In this talk, I'd like to take you on a short tour of how my brain works, and how it affects my work, communication and relationships.
I'll discuss hyperfocus, dopamine, the places where ADHD hurts me, the places where it helps me. You're invited to come take a 5 minute tour inside my brain. 
I'm sorry about the mess, I swear I had some good points lying around here somewhere!&quot;

            <h3>I can haz Ook!, an introduction to esoteric programming languages</h3>
            <i><a href="https://x.com/ties_ven">Ties van de Ven</a></i>
            <p>
&quot;Esoteric programming languages are a fun bit of internet history. Most new programming languages are invented to test out new concepts so they can be adopted by a mainstream language. 
But sometimes a new language is born with some... creative concepts. Concepts like, can you write software with only spaces, can you compile an abstract painting, and can you create a language within a language to exploit ebay.
Join me today for a fun introduction in esoteric programming languages.&quot;

            <h3>When the saints code marching in</h3>
            <i>Herman Peeren</i>
            <p>
&quot;Coding is creative, and divine inspiration can help. Did you know there is a whole team of saints available to help us create better code, avoid bugs, improve teamwork and, yes.. even write documentation? 
Saints have always been in the cloud, but there are still updates released. Old wisdom recompiled. It is never too late for miracles!&quot;

            <h3>To what extent are anthropomorphic chatbots able to humanise human-machine interactions?</h3>
            <i><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/justin-van-wijk/">Justin van Wijk</a></i>
            <p>
&quot;I was talking to chatbot Replika for scientific purposes only (trust me, I was not really trying to fall in love with an AI-girlfriend!).&quot;
