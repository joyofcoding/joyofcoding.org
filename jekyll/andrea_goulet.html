                <h2>Empathy Is a Technical Skill</h2>
                <p>
                    Empathy isn't a "soft" skill â€” it's a software skill. That's right. You read that correctly.
                    Empathy is deeply technical and not a fluffy-feely fad.
                    Empathy is a critical component of any tech stack and an essential element for building software systems that are easy to deploy and maintain.

                    In this engaging presentation, software developers, engineers, and the people who support them will walk away with concrete and contextualized practices.
                    You'll look at empathy through a systems-engineering lens and get immediately implementable ideas for using empathy in a technical way to improve code quality and collaboration.
                    Skeptical? Good. This is one talk you won't want to miss.
