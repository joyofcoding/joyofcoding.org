### Mob Programming

If you think pair programming (2 people on 1 computer) is crazy, hold onto your hats; it’s time for Mob Programming.

Mob Programming: All the brilliant people working on the same thing, at the same time, in the same place, and on the same computer. 

We are going to take a look at a new way of working, what it looks like, and why it can work. More importantly, we’ll have a (very) short session of actual mobbing, so you can see for yourself and come to your own conclusions.
