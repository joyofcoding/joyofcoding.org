bio          = "Jessica Kerr develops software in Scala, Elm, and far too many other language systems. She's fascinated by sociotechnical systems, meta-automation, and socks. She travels from St. Louis, MO to learn and speak about programming at conferences. Her older daughter wants to be a programmer, while her younger daughter wishes she wouldn't travel so much. Jessica is known for her enthusiasm about almost everything, especially food and Atomist."
