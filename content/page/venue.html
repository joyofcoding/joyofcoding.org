                  <p>This year’s Joy of Coding will take place in <a href="http://www.dedoelen.nl">De Doelen</a>, a concert venue and convention center in Rotterdam. Although mainly known as a venue for classical music and jazz, it is also a superb conference location. The monumental building stands right in front of the Rotterdam Centraal train station.</p>

                    <h3>Getting there</h3>
                    <p>Our venue “De Doelen” consists of several districts, each with their own entrance. Joy of Coding will take place in the <em>Willem Burger Kwartier</em>, for which the address of the entrance is: <strong>Kruisplein 40</strong> in Rotterdam.</p>
                    <p>Since the venue is located right in front of the main station, <em>Rotterdam Centraal</em>, the connections with various modes of public transport can not be any better. From the square in front of the station you will see the tall building of the Manhattan Hotel (soon to be the Marriott Hotel), the venue of the conference is right behind that building.</p>

                    <h3>About Rotterdam</h3>
                    <p>Rotterdam is a a futuristic city, that is always being refactored. Just like in our code, old urban elements that no longer serve their purpose, are continuously being replaced by newer and ever more exciting structures. Such as the Erasmus bridge, Central Station, the Market Hall and the Timmerhuis. On the other hand, there is plenty of reuse also: there are many monumental buildings that are left intact, but repurposed for other ends, such as last year's venue, Van Nelle Factory.</p>
