            <p>Joy of Coding 2025 will take place in <a class="ab-link" href="http://www.dedoelen.nl">De Doelen</a>, a concert venue and convention center in Rotterdam. Although mainly known as a venue for classical music and jazz, it is also a superb conference location.</p>
            
            <h2 id="directions">Getting there</h2>
            <p>Our venue ‘De Doelen’ consists of several areas, each with its own entrance. Joy of Coding will take place in the <em>Willem Burger Kwartier</em> which has its entrance at the Kruiskade.</p>
            <p>The venue is five minutes’ walk from the front of <em>Rotterdam Centraal</em> train station, so public transport links are ideal.</p>
            <p><b>Address</b>: De Doelen, ingang Willem Burger Kwartier, Kruisplein 40, 3012 CC Rotterdam</p>

            <h2 id="parking">Public Transport</h2>
    
            <p>Get the train/metro/bus to Rotterdam Central Station and <a class="ab-link" href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Rotterdam+Centraal+Station,+Stationsplein+2,+3013+AJ+Rotterdam/51.9218971,4.4715742/@51.9224912,4.469944,17z/data=!4m9!4m8!1m5!1m1!1s0x47c434a5b6024787:0x332d3e78fcabe64e!2m2!1d4.4684706!2d51.9252399!1m0!3e2">walk 5 minutes to the venue</a>.
               If you come from Schiphol Airport the fastest train is the 'Intercity Direct' which connects straight to Rotterdam (30 minutes).         
            </p>

         <div class="col-sm-5 twocol">

            <h2 id="parking">Car</h2>
            
            <p>If you arrive by car, paid parking is available in the <a class="ab-link" href="https://www.rotterdam.nl/parkeergarage-schouwburgplein-1">Schouwburgplein underground car park</a>. 
               There are two car park entrances: one on Schouwburgplein itself, and one via <em>parkeercluster Rotterdam Centraal</em> from the entrance in the Weena tunnel in front of station Rotterdam Centraal. 
               Also check out the various <a class="ab-link" href="https://www.ret.nl/en/home/travelling-with-the-ret/your-trip-from-door-to-door/p-r-sites.html">[P+R]'s</a> at the edge of the city.</p>

            <h2 id="rotterdam">About Rotterdam</h2>
    
            <p>Rotterdam is a city from the future that is undergoing constant refactoring. As in our code, legacy urban elements are continuously being replaced by more exciting modern structures. The Erasmus bridge, Central Station, the Market Hall and the Timmerhuis are recent examples, but not the last. Meanwhile, building reuse gives many historical monuments new roles.</p>

            <h2>Conference room</h2>
            <p>The conference room is on the <a class="ab-link" href="https://www.dedoeleniccrotterdam.nl/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/NL_026-ICC_Plattegrond_Willem_3e_Etage.pdf">3rd floor</a>. Multiple escalators take you up there from the ground floor. For people who have trouble using the escalator, there is also an elevator. This is quite hidden, so ask for it at the reception (at the <a class="ab-link" href="https://www.dedoeleniccrotterdam.nl/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/NL_026-ICC_Plattegrond_Willem_BG.pdf">ground floor</a>).</p>

            <p>'De Doelen' is fully wheelchair accessable. Assistance animals are allowed at the venue. 
            We can arrange to have your mobility scooter recharged. Please also talk to one of the organizers or volunteers, so we can arrange the best seating in the room for you as well.
            The conference room has an induction loop.</p>

            <h2>Toilets</h2>
            <p>There are two sets of toilets on the same floor as the conference room. One is located near the main conference room entrance, the other is near the quiet room.</p>

            <h2>Catering</h2>
            <p>We’ll provide lunch, including vegetarian and vegan options. If you have any special dietary restrictions, be sure to let us know. The lunch is buffet style. There will be signs outlining the allergens.</p>
            <p>Please note that because of budgetary constraints there won't be any proper snacks after the conference. There will be drinks though!</p>

         </div>
         <div class="col-sm-5 twocol">

            <p>There is limited seating available in the foyer. If having a seat is absolutely necessary for you, please let us know, and we'll make sure one is reserved for you.</p>

            <h2>Quiet room</h2>
            <p>There is a quiet room where people can retreat if the noise levels from their fellow attendees gets too much. We will also actively monitor this room to make sure it won't be used for things such as conference calls. Conversation will be allowed, as long as it not disturbing anyone else. If you are in the quiet room and something bothers you, please let the attendant know.</p>

            <h2>Pronoun stickers</h2>
            <p>We will encourage all our participants to wear a pronoun sticker on their name badge. This is of course still voluntary, but we hope our cis-gender guests will wear them as well to show their support of their non-binary fellow attendees.</p>

            <h2>Recordings</h2>
            <p>All talks will be recorded and made available on our <a class="ab-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/@JoyOfCodingConferences">Joy of Coding Youtube channel</a> after the conference.</p>
