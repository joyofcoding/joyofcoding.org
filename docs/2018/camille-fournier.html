      <p>We all get stuck occasionally on hard bugs, challenging projects, or even unexpected resistance from our colleagues. In this talk, I'll discuss some advanced techniques for figuring out the problem, avoiding the problem in the first place, and removing barriers that keep us from fixing common project pitfalls.</p>
