      <p>Games are a safe place where you can practice unusual behaviors without being afraid of the consequences. What is important for a facilitator is to help participants to transfer acquired sub-conscious knowledge into real-life patterns. In these five minutes I will do my best to ignite the spark of curiosity and give some advice about what every coder can learn from games.</p>
      
      <h2 id="speaker">About the speaker</h2>

      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/p_stanika">@p_stanika</a></p>
      
      <p>In 2001, while working as a counselor in a kids camp, Stanislava started using games to coach children to gain insights into their behavior. Only when she moved to the Netherlands fifteen years later did she learn that there’s a name for that - ‘serious games’. Since then she has worked as a personal and group training facilitator, using many games and gamified exercises to engage people and trigger them to change.</p>
      
      <p>Stanislava currently works as a Scrum master at Quby (Amsterdam) and is re-learning how to use her favourite tools in a different country, with IT and business people.</p>
