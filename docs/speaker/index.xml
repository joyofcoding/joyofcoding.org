During the conference, the huge video wall will be running an AI programming challenge. Code your own bot on your laptop and watch it compete with other people’s bots on the big screen.
AIsland is a turn-based strategy game for 2-8 bot players, entered for each round by their humans. The winner of each round is the bot that successfully takes over the generated island landscape by removing the other players.</description>

      <description>The Joy of Stochastic Gradient Descent We’ll take a look at the joys of Deep Learning from its simple, elegant fundamentals to its feats of impressive power. Along the way, we’ll discuss how Deep Learning is changing how we approach programming, communicate with each other, and even what it means to be human.

      <description>How to hire and work with people who aren’t like you Diversity and Inclusion initiatives have cost many technology companies hundreds of millions but there has been little change in who works in tech. This talk will examine conventional wisdom in changing the workforce makeup in tech, how we got to our current state and what practical actions companies can take so that diversity is built into their cultural operation system.</description>

      <description>Shaving the Golden Yak Programming is a series of frustrations. Everything we do, we could do better or faster if we only had our tools set up just so. If our error messages were a little better, our code a little cleaner, our tests a lot wider. How do you balance the work you’re supposed to be doing with the work that makes your work, work? Dive into the yak stack with me.</description>

      <description>Living the Good Life Most people imagine the ancient Greek philosophers to be white-haired old men with nothing better to do, running around trying to solve impossible questions like, ‘How do we know the world exists if we have no senses?’ or ‘If a tree falls in a forest, with no one around to hear it, does it still make noise?’. Most of the time, we consider these questions nonsensical, inane, and not really worth the time to debate except when really, really drunk.</description>

      <description>Mob Programming If you think pair programming (2 people on 1 computer) is crazy, hold onto your hats; it’s time for Mob Programming.
Mob Programming: All the brilliant people working on the same thing, at the same time, in the same place, and on the same computer.
We are going to take a look at a new way of working, what it looks like, and why it can work.</description>

      <description>Stories Every Developer Should Know  &amp;ldquo;Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.&amp;rdquo; – George Santayana 
 &amp;ldquo;The past is never dead. It’s not even past.&amp;rdquo; – William Faulkner 
Most architects and developers pursue the Latest and Greatest with great fervor, yet the history of engineering, including software projects, contains rich lessons that we risk repeating ad nauseam. This keynote recounts a variety of stories of projects that failed architecturally…and why.</description>

      <description>RoboCup Junior is a robot competition for kids up to 19 years of age, with categories for soccer, rescue and dance.
Teams that compete in the dance division create both a robot and a dance composition for the robot to perform. Each entry consists of a two-minute dance performance choreographed to music, with particular attention for construction and programming. Team members can join in to dance alongside the robot.</description>

      <description>By Linda van der Pal
Whether you’ve never attended a developer conference before, or if you’ve been around the circuit for years, occasionally they can be a lonely experience.
Joy of Coding tries to remove that feeling with a session of Speed Meeting. In this session you will introduce yourself to several other conference attendees in short introductions of a few minutes each. In this introduction you are invited to talk with one other participant about who you both are, and why you are here.</description>
