           <p>In June COVID will still be with us, unfortunately. 
              The rules for events change often and with little notice.
              The same applies for international travel.
              We're planning for all possible scenario's and are committed to deliver you the best Joy of Coding possible within the bounds of these rules.

           <h2 id="corona-check">Corona Check</h2>
           <p>On the 25th of February most of the COVID restrictions were lifted in the Netherlands.
              For attending Joy of Coding no additional proof of vaccination or testing will be necessary.
              Let hope we can keep it that way.
           </p>          
           <p>The <a href="https://coronacheck.nl/en/">Corona Check-app</a> may still <i>become</i> an access requirement. 
              <i>If</i> that is the case, make sure you can show your valid QR code on your smartphone or on paper together with a valid ID. 
           </p>
           <p>An European Digital Covid Certificate (DCC) can be used if you are not a Dutch national and <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/coronavirus-response/safe-covid-19-vaccines-europeans/eu-digital-covid-certificate_en#how-can-citizens-get-the-certificate">your country</a> has joined the initiative.
              If your country isn't on the list, you can get tested at <a href="https://www.testenvoortoegang.org/">testenvoortoegang.org</a></p>

           <h2 id="corona-travel">Travel</h2>
           <p>We expect face masks still to be required in public transport. 
              If you are traveling to the Netherlands from abroad check <a href="https://reizentijdenscorona.rijksoverheid.nl/en">reizentijdenscorona.rijksoverheid.nl</a>

           <h2 id="corona-inside">Inside</h2>
           <p>The Willem Burger Quarter, where the conference is held, is spacious, has high ceilings and good ventilation. It's maximum capacity is 700 
              and we expect to fill about 250, so there will be plenty of room to keep a safe distance.</p>

           <h2 id="corona-inside">Symptoms? Stay home!</h2>
           <p>If you have any symptoms associated with COVID, such as a cold, a runny nose, 
              sore throat, mild cough, shortness of breath, raised temperature or fever: stay at home and let us know via email.
