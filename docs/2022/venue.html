            <p>Joy of Coding 2022 will take place in <a href="http://www.dedoelen.nl">De Doelen</a>, a concert venue and convention center in Rotterdam. Although mainly known as a venue for classical music and jazz, it is also a superb conference location. The monumental building stands right in front of the Rotterdam Centraal train station.</p>
            <h2 id="directions">Getting there</h2>
            <p>Our venue ‘De Doelen’ consists of several areas, each with its own entrance. Joy of Coding will take place in the <em>Willem Burger Kwartier</em>, for which the <a href="./practical.html">address</a> of the entrance is.</p>
            <p>The venue is five minutes’ walk from the front of <em>Rotterdam Centraal</em> train station, so public transport links are ideal.</p>
            <h2 id="facilities">Facilities</h2>
            <p>The venue is fully wheelchair <a href="#accessibility">accessable</a>. If you have special needs, please <a href="mailto:info@joyofcoding.org">contact us</a>.</p>

            <h2 id="parking">Parking</h2>
            <p>If you arrive by car, you can park in the <a href="http://www.rotterdam.nl/ParkeergarageSchouwburgplein">Schouwburgplein underground car park</a>. There are two car park entrances: one on Schouwburgplein itself, and one via <em>parkeercluster Rotterdam Centraal</em> from the entrance in the Weena tunnel in front of station Rotterdam Centraal. You can reserve parking with substantial discounts at <a href="http://parkereninrotterdam.nl/parkeergarage/schouwburgplein/">parkereninrotterdam.nl</a>.</p>
            <h2 id="rotterdam">About Rotterdam</h2>
            <p>Rotterdam is a city from the future that is undergoing constant refactoring. As in our code, legacy urban elements are continuously being replaced by more exciting modern structures. The Erasmus bridge, Central Station, the Market Hall and the Timmerhuis are recent examples, but not the last. Meanwhile, building reuse gives many historical monuments new roles.</p>

            <h2>Conference room</h2>
            <p>The conference room is on the <a href="https://www.dedoeleniccrotterdam.nl/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/NL_026-ICC_Plattegrond_Willem_3e_Etage.pdf">3rd floor</a>. Multiple escalators take you up there from the ground floor. For people who have trouble using the escalator, there is also an elevator. This is quite hidden, so ask for it at the reception (at the <a href="https://www.dedoeleniccrotterdam.nl/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/NL_026-ICC_Plattegrond_Willem_BG.pdf">ground floor</a>).</p>
            <p>Assistance animals are allowed at the venue. We can arrange to have your mobility scooter recharged. Please also talk to one of the organizers or volunteers, so we can arrange the best seating in the room for you as well.
            The conference room has an induction loop.</p>
            
            <h2>Toilets</h2>
            <p>There are two sets of toilets on the same floor as the conference room. One is located near the main conference room entrance, the other is near the quiet room.</p>
            
            <h2>Catering</h2>
            <p>For lunch and the snacks after the conference, we have taken extra care this year that there are also going to be vegan options. If you have any special dietary restrictions, be sure to let us know so we can inform our caterer and have a special lunch made for you. Both lunch and the after-conference snacks are buffet style. We intend to have chalkboards outlining the allergens. We will also have straws available with the drinks.</p> 
            <p>There is limited seating available in the foyer. If having a seat is absolutely necessary for you, please let us know, and we'll make sure one is reserved for you.</p>

         <div class="col-sm-5 twocol">
         
            <h2>Quiet room</h2>
            <p>There is a quiet room where people can retreat if the noise levels from their fellow attendees gets too much. We will also actively monitor this room to make sure it won't be used for things such as conference calls. Conversation will be allowed, as long as it not disturbing anyone else. If you are in the quiet room and something bothers you, please let the attendant know.</p>
            
            <h2>Pronoun stickers</h2>
            <p>We will encourage all our participants to wear a pronoun sticker on their name badge. This is of course still voluntary, but we hope our cis-gender guests will wear them as well to show their support of their non-binary fellow attendees.</p>
            
            <h2>Recordings</h2>
            <p>All talks will be recorded and made available on our <a href="https://www.infoq.com/joy-of-coding/">Joy of Coding channel</a> on InfoQ after the conference.</p>
            
            <h2>Questions</h2>
            <p>If you have any specific questions, feel free to ask. </p>

          <p>Here are the different kinds of tickets we sell for the conference. Get your tickets <a href="https://joyofcoding.stager.nl/web/tickets/403575" target="_blank">in the shop!</a></p>
          <h2>Early Bird Tickets</h2>         
          <p>The Early Bird Tickets are sold when the we're still busy making the program. You're in for a surprise and a discount!</p>
          <h2>Regular Tickets</h2>
          <p>These are the regular full price tickets, which are, in fact, still quite affordable!</p>
          <h2>Student Tickets</h2>         
          <p>We offer a limited number of Student Tickets at a reduced price to allow students to visit the conference. 
             The requirement for these tickets is that you can proof that you are a student at the registration desk, for example with a student id.</p>

          <h2>Diversity Tickets</h2>         
          <p>Most of the people who visit our conference are professional software developers and as such will often be able to have their employer pay for their tickets. We really appreciate all the companies that invest in their employees by allowing them to come to our conference.</p>
          <p>However, not everybody is in that situation. To help people who would otherwise not be able to attend our conference we offer diversity tickets. These are not meant for students (they have their own discount), but for anybody who would like to attend our conference but would not be able to do so at the full ticket prices.</p>
          <p>We use the honour system for diversity tickets, so we don't require any proof that you would otherwise be unable to afford a ticket. Just keep in mind that the number of these tickets that we can offer is very low, so if you buy one someone else might miss out.</p>
          <p>The only real requirement we have for buying a diversity ticket is that you pay it with your own money. If your employer pays for your ticket, you are not eligible.</p>
          <p>The sale for diversity tickets starts when the full conference program is known. Use promocode DIVDIV2022 to get your diversity ticket!</p>
