            <h2>Software development</h2>
            <span>
              Joy of Coding is a one-day single-track conference held in Rotterdam. We bring internationally renowned
              speakers to Rotterdam to deliver talks. They cover diverse aspects of the craft, reflecting recent trends
              in industry and academia, as well as a serious amount of joy.
            </span>
            <h2>It's affordable</h2>
            <span>
              Joy of Coding is a non-profit event. With the help of our sponsors we keep registration fees low to
              provide the best value-for-money conference of 2024, just like our previous editions!
            </span>
            <h2>It's by dev, for devs</h2>
            <span>
              Joy of Coding is organised by a bunch of developers. There is no commercial agenda, the schedule is purely
              based on stuff that developers, like us, love to see. Expert speakers but no talking heads. A place where
              we can all get together and talk about code.

              He started his professional career over 20 years ago and has since then worked as a software engineer and architect both in the Netherlands and abroad.
              Over time he discovered that building software was fun, but breaking stuff was even more fulfilling... and he discovered his passion for cyber security.
              Going all-in with ethical hacking, bug bounties, participating in international hacking competitions, secure coding and multiple CISO roles,
              he combined his skills to build bridges between the business, software development and cyber security domains.
              More than 2 years ago, he founded Scyon with the goal of helping organisations in adopting a shift-left approach to their cyber security efforts and bolster their overall cyber resilience.
